# ICP Signal Dashboard

Show me the signal dashboard with stats and trends.

Execute `npm run dashboard` in `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine`.

Also read `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine\output\latest.json` and `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine\data\memory\` (if it exists) to show:

1. **Pipeline Stats** — total runs, total signals found, last run time
2. **Top Sources** — which data source produces the most signals
3. **Top Signal Categories** — which buying intent categories are trending
4. **Company Memory** — companies that have appeared multiple times (repeat signals = hot leads)
5. **Signal Trend** — are signals increasing or decreasing vs last run?

Present this as a clean dashboard summary I can read in 30 seconds.
