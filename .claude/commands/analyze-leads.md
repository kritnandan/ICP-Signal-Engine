# Deep Lead Analysis

Perform a deep analysis of the current signals and tell me exactly what action to take.

1. Read `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine\output\latest.json`
2. Read all files in `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine\output\runs\` (last 3 runs if available) to understand trends
3. Read `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine\data\memory\` directory if it exists to check company history
4. Read `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine\config\icp.json` to understand our ICP targeting rules

**Then deliver:**

### Account-by-Account Breakdown
For each company with signals, tell me:
- What they're signaling (procurement pain points, tech evaluation, budget cycle)
- Their buying stage: Awareness / Research / Evaluation / Decision / Implementation
- Why they match our ICP (which criteria triggered)
- The specific signal text that caught our attention
- **Recommended outreach**: What to say, who to contact, what case study or value prop to lead with

### Pattern Analysis
- Are there industry-wide trends? (e.g. "5 manufacturing companies all mentioning TMS this week")
- Any companies showing escalating signals across multiple runs?

### What To Do RIGHT NOW
Give me a numbered to-do list of outreach actions for today, ordered by priority.
