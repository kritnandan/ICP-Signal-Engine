# Run Tests

Run the full test suite for the ICP Signal Engine project.

Execute `npm test` in `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine`.

After tests complete:
1. Show total passed / failed / skipped
2. If any tests failed, show the exact error messages and which files failed
3. If all pass, confirm the project is healthy
4. Show test coverage summary if available

This runs 61 tests across signal classification, ICP matching, collectors, memory, and output modules.
