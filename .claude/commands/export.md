# Export Leads to Excel

Export the current signals to an Excel spreadsheet.

Execute `npm run export` in `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine`.

After export:
1. Confirm the exact file path where the Excel was saved
2. Tell me how many rows are in the Signals sheet
3. Remind me what columns are included (Company, Signal Strength, Category, Confidence, Source, URL, Date, etc.)

The Excel file will be in `d:\ICP-Signal-Engine\output\` — tell me the exact filename so I can open it directly.
